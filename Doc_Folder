Project Spec for Personalized Fitness Assistant
General Description
The Personalized Fitness Assistant is a mobile application designed to provide customized workout plans based on user input. Users will enter their fitness goals, current fitness level, available equipment, days per week, and time commitment for workouts. The app will generate a weekly workout plan tailored to these inputs and track the user's progress over time. The goal is to offer a straightforward and user-friendly solution for busy individuals who want to maintain or improve their fitness.
The project will be developed using Python on Visual Studio Code and managed through GitHub. Basic workout routines will be sourced from public fitness databases such as Muscle and Strength and possibly using ChatGPT for dynamic content generation. The app will feature a simple and intuitive user interface to ensure accessibility for beginners and fitness enthusiasts alike.
External Mechanisms:
•	Public Fitness Databases: e.g., Muscle and Strength (https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises)
•	ChatGPT: For dynamic workout content generation (https://chatgpt.com/?oai-dm=1&model=auto)
•	GitHub: For version control and project management
•	Visual Studio Code: Development environment
GUI and CLI: The ideal GUI will include input forms for user data, a weekly workout plan display, and progress tracking charts or logs. The app could also run minimally with a command-line interface (CLI) where users input data through text commands and receive text-based workout plans and logs.
Task Vignettes
1. User Input (Fitness Information)
Jane, a busy professional, downloads the Personalized Fitness Assistant app to help her stay fit. Upon opening the app, she is prompted to enter her fitness goal (e.g., lose weight), current fitness level (beginner), available equipment (dumbbells), days per week she can work out (3 days), and time commitment per session (30 minutes). Jane fills out the form and submits her information.
Technical Details:
•	Display input form with fields for fitness goal, fitness level, equipment, days per week, and time commitment.
•	Validate input data and store in a user profile.
•	Use default values or recommendations if some inputs are left blank.
2. Generate Workout Plan
Once Jane submits her information, the app generates a personalized weekly workout plan. The plan includes short, effective exercises that fit her schedule and equipment availability. The workout plan is displayed in a user-friendly weekly format on the app's main screen.
Technical Details:
•	Use a workout generation algorithm that considers user input.
•	Fetch basic workout routines from public databases or dynamically generate them using ChatGPT.
•	Display the workout plan in a structured weekly format, with clear instructions for each exercise.
3. Log Workouts and Track Progress
Jane completes her first workout and logs her activity in the app. She continues to log her workouts daily. The app tracks her progress and provides basic feedback through charts or logs. Jane can see her progress over time, which keeps her motivated.
Technical Details:
•	Provide an interface for users to log their workouts, including the ability to mark exercises as complete and enter additional notes.
•	Track workout completion and generate progress reports.
•	Display progress using simple charts or logs, updating in real-time as new data is entered.
4. Update and Refine Workout Plan
After a few weeks, Jane feels more confident and wants to increase her workout intensity. She updates her fitness level to "intermediate" and adjusts her available equipment to include resistance bands. The app generates a new workout plan based on the updated information.
Technical Details:
•	Allow users to update their profile information at any time.
•	Re-run the workout generation algorithm with updated inputs.
•	Ensure the new workout plan reflects changes in user capability and equipment.
Technical Flow
Data Flow Diagram
1.	User Input: Collect fitness goals, fitness level, equipment, days per week, and time commitment.
2.	Data Validation: Ensure all inputs are valid and store them in the user profile.
3.	Workout Generation: Generate a workout plan using a combination of static routines from public databases and dynamic content from ChatGPT.
4.	Workout Display: Render the workout plan in a user-friendly format.
5.	Workout Logging: Allow users to log completed workouts and store the data.
6.	Progress Tracking: Generate and display progress reports using logged data.
7.	Profile Update: Enable users to update their information and regenerate workout plans.
Data Blocks

Final (Self) Assessment
1.	Biggest or Most Unexpected Change from Sketch:
o	The addition of dynamic content generation using ChatGPT was a significant enhancement from the initial sketch.
2.	Confidence in Implementing the Spec:
o	I feel fairly confident about implementing the spec as written. The core functionalities are well-defined, and the technical details provide a hopefully clear roadmap.
3.	Biggest Potential Problem:
o	Integrating dynamic workout content generation from ChatGPT could be challenging, especially ensuring the generated content is relevant and accurate.
4.	Least Familiar Parts:
o	I am least familiar with integrating external APIs like ChatGPT for content generation. I might need help with understanding how to fetch and utilize data from these APIs securely and efficiently.
By following this spec, the Personalized Fitness Assistant app will provide a user-friendly and effective solution for generating and tracking personalized workout plans, helping users stay fit and motivated.
