Title: Personalized Fitness Assistant
Description: This project aims to develop a simple mobile application that provides basic personalized workout plans based on user input. Users will enter their fitness goals, current fitness level, and available equipment. The app will generate a straightforward workout plan and track the user's progress.
Use Case: Jane Doe, a busy professional, wants to stay fit but has limited time. She downloads the Personalized Fitness Assistant app, enters her goal (e.g., lose weight), current fitness level (beginner), and available equipment (dumbbells). The app provides her with a weekly workout plan with short, effective exercises. Jane logs her workouts in the app, which tracks her progress and provides basic feedback.
